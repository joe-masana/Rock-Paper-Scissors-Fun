# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Fun
Basic Rock, Paper, Scissors Game using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Fun is a simple rock-paper-scissors style game that I developed using purely HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
This is my first project completed entirely on my own. I wanted to put together a simple page that made use of Javascript switches,
JQuery, and if statements.
